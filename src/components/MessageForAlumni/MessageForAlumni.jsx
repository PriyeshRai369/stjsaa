                  As we celebrate 40 years of the St. John's School, BLW,
                  Varanasi Alumni Association, I am filled with immense pride
                  and gratitude. Founded with a vision to connect and support
                  our diverse alumni family, the association has grown into a
                  vibrant community. Our journey over these decades reflects our
                  collective achievements and the enduring spirit of St. John's.
                  Together, we have built lasting friendships, supported one
                  another, and contributed to society. As we look to the future,
                  let's continue to uphold the values instilled in us and
                  strengthen the bonds that unite us.

                  As we mark the 25th anniversary of the 1999 batch from St.
                  John's School, BLW, Varanasi, I am honored to represent our
                  incredible journey. These past 25 years have been a testament
                  to the values and lessons we learned within those cherished
                  school walls. Our bonds have only strengthened over time, and
                  our achievements reflect the foundation laid at St. John's. As
                  we celebrate this milestone, let's reconnect, reminisce, and
                  renew our commitment to supporting each other and our alma
                  mater. Together, we continue to embody the spirit of our
                  school.
